# Implementation Plan: Black-Scholes Calculator

**Branch**: `001-black-scholes-calculator` | **Date**: 2025-10-30 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-black-scholes-calculator/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a Black-Scholes calculator as a client-side rendered Single Page Application (SPA). The application will be built using Next.js, React, Shadcn components, and TailwindCSS. It will allow users to calculate option prices, greeks, and implied volatility. The 10 most recent calculations will be stored in the browser's local storage for easy access.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 16, React, Shadcn, TailwindCSS
**Storage**: Browser Local Storage
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Web Browser
**Project Type**: Web Application
**Performance Goals**: Core calculations to be completed in under 100ms.
**Constraints**: All external packages and libraries must be open source (MIT license) and have been regularly updated within the last year.
**Scale/Scope**: This is a single-user application with no backend. All calculations and data storage will happen on the client-side.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Modern and Sleek Architecture**: PASS. The proposed stack (Next.js, React, Shadcn, TailwindCSS) aligns with building a modern and sleek SPA.
- **II. Testable**: PASS. The plan includes Jest and React Testing Library for unit and component testing.
- **III. Secure**: PASS. As a client-side only application, the attack surface is minimal. We will ensure that any user-provided data is properly sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.

**Structure Decision**: A web application structure is chosen to separate the frontend code. Since there is no backend, we will only have the `frontend` directory.
