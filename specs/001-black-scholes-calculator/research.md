# Research: Black-Scholes Calculator

**Purpose**: To document research and decisions made during the planning phase.

## Decisions

- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library were chosen as they are the standard for testing React applications and provide a robust environment for both unit and integration testing.
- **UI Components**: Shadcn was chosen for its well-designed and accessible components that can be easily integrated into a Next.js application with TailwindCSS.
- **State Management**: Given the limited scope of the application, React's built-in state management (useState, useReducer) will be sufficient. No external state management library is needed at this time.
